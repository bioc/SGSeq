Title: Prediction, quantification and visualization of splice events
       from RNA-seq data
Version: 1.1.28
Author: Leonard Goldstein
Maintainer: Leonard Goldstein <goldstel@gene.com>
Description: Prediction of splice junctions, exons from BAM files. 
	     Quantification of splice junctions, exons based on 
	     compatible reads (counts, FPKMs). Identification of
	     splice events from implied splice graph. Quantification
	     of splice variants based on compatible reads spanning
 	     event boundaries (counts, psi-values). Functions for
	     annotation and visualization.
