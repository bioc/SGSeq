Title: Splice event detection and quantification from RNA-seq data
Version: 1.3.8
Author: Leonard Goldstein
Maintainer: Leonard Goldstein <goldstel@gene.com>
Description: Predict splice junctions and exons from BAM files and obtain
	     compatible read counts and FPKMs. Identify splice events and
	     estimate relative usage of splice variants based on compatible
	     read counts at event boundaries.
