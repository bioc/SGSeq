Title: Splice event prediction and quantification from RNA-seq data
Version: 1.5.3
Author: Leonard Goldstein
Maintainer: Leonard Goldstein <goldstel@gene.com>
Description: Predict splice junctions and exons from BAM files and obtain
    compatible read counts and FPKMs. Identify splice events and
    estimate relative usage of splice variants based on compatible
    read counts at event boundaries.
