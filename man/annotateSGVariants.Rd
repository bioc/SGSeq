\description{
Annotate splice variants in terms of canonical events.
}
\details{
The following events are considered:

\describe{
  \item{dQuote{SE}}{skipped exon}
  \item{dQuote{S2E}}{two consecutive exons skipped}
  \item{dQuote{RI}}{retained intron}
  \item{dQuote{MXE}}{mutually exclusive exons}
  \item{dQuote{A5SS}}{alternative 5' splice site}
  \item{dQuote{A3SS}}{alternative 3' splice site}
  \item{dQuote{AFE}}{alternative first exon}
  \item{dQuote{ALE}}{alternative last exon}
  \item{dQuote{AS}}{alternative start other than \dQuote{AFE}}
  \item{dQuote{AE}}{alternative end other than \dQuote{ALE}}
}

For events \dQuote{SE} and \dQuote{S2E}, suffixes \dQuote{I} and
\dQuote{S} indicate inclusion and skipping, respectively.
For event \dQuote{RI} suffixes \dQuote{E} and \dQuote{R} indicate
exclusion and retention, respectively.
For events \dQuote{A5SS} and \dQuote{A3SS}, suffixes \dQuote{P} and
\dQuote{D} indicate use of the proximal (intron-shortening) and
distal (intron-lengthening) splice site, respectively.

All considered events are binary events defined by two alternative
variants. A variant is annotated as a canonical event if it coincides
with one of the two variants in the canonical event, and there is at
least one variant in the same event that coincides with the second
variant of the canonical event.
